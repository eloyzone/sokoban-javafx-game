# How can I deploy it?
There are plenty of ways for deploying a JavaFX application (especially through your preferable IDE) but I have chosen one of the easiest one. You can use following command to deploy your application. Bottom-mentioned maven command is a plugin that helps you to deploy it easily.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.zenjava</groupId>
    <artifactId>javafx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>8.8.3</version>
    <configuration>
        <mainClass>com.github.eloyzone.sokobanjavafxgame.Main</mainClass>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```
To create your executable file with JavaFX-magic, call `mvn jfx:jar`. The jar-file will be placed at `target/jfx/app`.
